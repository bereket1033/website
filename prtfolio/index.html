                <h2>Bereket Ghion</h2>
                <p>Hello, my name is Bereket ghion.I am a third year computer Science engineering student at adam astu.
                    With my part time I am engaged with web development and interior design works.As for my interior design works I attached some pictures on the ‘portfolio’ section. 
                    I do this interior design works with my brothers we are also engaged in putting the designs to the ground, 
                    with this experience am developing wood work skills besides the interior design part.
                    When we come to the web development I didn’t make any big projects yet but am trying to acquire enough knowledge in-order to make a quality websites.
                    Currently I am working on WordPress for developing websites,I am also trying to learn more about the open source.

                <h2 class="headings">Website Design</h2>
                <p>The project i am working on requires a firm grasp on software tools that are able to develop websites, 
                   databases and tools to connect websites to databases to make them interactive. 
                   Making websites and making them interactive with the help of PHP were new concepts for me.My knowledge of these tools was limited. 
                   I don’t have previous knowledge on how to write a PHP code so one of my limitations was making the form interactive so it’s 
                   able to receive input from the user and make changes to the database.Now i started using WordPress for my projects.
                   WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. 
                   Features include a plugin architecture and a template system, referred to within WordPress as Themes.</p>
